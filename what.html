      <td>Department of Water Resources California Water Plan program computes applied, net, and depletion water balances for California. These water balances are analyses of developed and dedicated water supplies, water uses by sector, water reuses, and operational characteristics for an area.  Dedicated and developed water supplies include surface water, groundwater, reused and recycled water.  Water uses by sector for these analyses include parameters for agriculture, urban, managed wetlands, and water dedicated to the environment, recognizing that water is often used multiple times and benefits multiple sectors. Water balance results show what water was applied to actual uses so that use equals supply.  Recent data provided includes water uses and supplies for WYs 2011-2015 at Detailed Analysis Unit by County (DAUCO),  Planning Area (PA), Hydrologic Region (HR), and Statewide spatial scales. Computation equations, for applied, net, and depletion water balances.  Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for data management and analyses are included in a .pdf file.   \r\n\r\nThe California Water Plan Update 2018 Water Balance Supporting Document includes water use and supply discussion, graphics, and links to files and folders of water use and supply data for 1998-2015, and related information.  There is also a 1-page Water Balance Fact Sheet available.</td>

      <td>&lt;p&gt;The GeoTracker GAMA (Groundwater Ambient Monitoring and Assessment Program) groundwater information system integrates and displays water quality data from various sources on an interactive Google-based map.  Analytical tools and reporting features help users assess groundwater quality and identify potential groundwater issues in California.  This data set is comprised of the Domestic Well  and Priority Basin Project.  The Domestic Well Project sampled domestic wells for commonly detected chemicals  to evaluate the quality of groundwater.  The Priority Basin Project provides a comprehensive assessment of statewide groundwater quality that helps identify and understand the risks to California's groundwater resources.&lt;/p&gt;</td>
